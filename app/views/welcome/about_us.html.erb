                    <p>Over the years we have been able to successfully service our partners with the following software solutions.</p>

                  	<hr class="col-md-12">
                  	<p>V1  - This is the version where it all started when we introduced many (functional / operational / viable / executable) risk management charts to our RFED partners and Introductory Brokers using 2-min, 15-min, 30-min, 1-hour and 1-day charts. These were done for all products including equities, bonds, mutual funds, currency, and derivative products.</p>
                    <p>V2 - Version 2 utilized the same charting system as Version 1, but not gave entry and exit positions on the charts and you could play or not play them based on the chart in front of you. </p>
                    <p>V3 - The latest version of our software is where our partners are enjoying fully automated trading solutions to benefit the (inexperienced / non-professional / unskilled) clients in account volume activity to benefit both them and us. </p>

                  	<h2 id="sec1">Custom Products</h2>
                  	<p>We have always thrived in providing a modest solution to specific markets, but due to high demand we understand that not all products are benefitted by our dedicated solutions. For an additional fee we can put together solutions for less used products.</p>

The reason we made the decision to target the forex market is due to its high volatility, unpredictability and we wanted to demonstrate our superior algorithm based PI in the harshest environment.</p>

          			<p>PI is our main software program that executes the trades for our clients based on a daily calibration. The PI’s main job is to perform multiple stages of data integrity checks and execute trades accordingly.</p>

                    <p>At the end of a trading day information from PI is handed over to SI and 26,000+ scenarios are crunched, analyzed and calibrated and given to AI. AI then performs an analysis on the best fits and puts the optimal settings back into PI for the following trading period. </p>
